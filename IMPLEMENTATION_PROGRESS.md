## ✅ Completed Features

### Phase 1: Core Banking Operations

#### 1. Transfer Page (`/transfer`)
- ✅ Full form implementation with validation
- ✅ Account and beneficiary selection
- ✅ Amount input with currency selection
- ✅ Transfer preview screen
- ✅ Connected to `mutationCreateExternalTransfer`
- ✅ Success/error notifications
- ✅ Fallback to mock data when API unavailable

#### 2. Deposit Page (`/deposit`)
- ✅ Multiple payment method selection (Bank Transfer, Card, Crypto)
- ✅ Dynamic fee calculation
- ✅ Amount validation with min/max limits
- ✅ Payment instructions display
- ✅ Connected to `mutationCreateDeposit`
- ✅ Method-specific instructions (IBAN for bank, address for crypto)

#### 3. Receive Page (`/receive`)
- ✅ Account details display (IBAN, SWIFT, etc.)
- ✅ International vs Domestic format toggle
- ✅ QR code generation for account details
- ✅ Copy-to-clipboard functionality
- ✅ Share functionality
- ✅ Download QR code as image
- ✅ Supported currencies display

### Infrastructure Components

#### Utilities Created
- ✅ **Notification System** (`Notification.tsx`)
  - Toast notifications with different types (success, error, warning, info)
  - Auto-dismiss with configurable duration
  - NotificationManager for global access
  
- ✅ **Validation Utilities** (`validation.ts`)
  - Amount, email, IBAN, SWIFT validation
  - Form validation for transfers, deposits, beneficiaries
  - Currency formatting utilities
  
- ✅ **Loading Components** (`LoadingSpinner.tsx`)
  - Configurable size spinner
  - Full-screen and overlay variants
  - Loading text support

#### API Infrastructure
- ✅ Added payment methods query and loader
- ✅ Created hook for payment methods (`usePaymentMethods`)
- ✅ Integrated all components with real API or mock fallback

## 🚧 Remaining Tasks

### High Priority
1. **Withdrawal Page** - Needs new mutation definition
2. **Beneficiaries Page** - CRUD operations for managing beneficiaries
3. **Exchange Page** - Currency conversion with live rates

### Medium Priority
4. **Settings Page** - User preferences and security settings
5. **Analytics Page** - Transaction reports and spending analysis

### API Mutations Still Needed
```graphql
# Withdrawal
mutation createWithdrawal($amount: String!, ...) {
  create_npa_withdrawal(...)
}

# Currency Exchange
mutation createExchange($from_amount: String!, ...) {
  create_npa_exchange(...)
}

# Beneficiary Management
mutation updateBeneficiary($id: String!, ...) {
  update_npa_beneficiary(...)
}
mutation deleteBeneficiary($id: String!) {
  delete_npa_beneficiary(...)
}

# Settings
mutation updateUserSettings(...) {
  update_user_settings(...)
}
```

## 📊 Progress Summary

- **Pages Implemented**: 3/8 functional pages
- **Mutations Connected**: 2/3 existing mutations
- **Infrastructure**: 100% complete (notifications, validation, loading states)
- **Error Handling**: Implemented across all completed pages
- **Mock Data Fallback**: Working for all components

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. Implement Withdrawal Page with new mutation
2. Create Beneficiaries management page
3. Build Exchange page with rate calculation
4. Add remaining mutations to GraphQL schema
5. Implement Settings and Analytics pages
6. Add unit tests for validation utilities
7. Create E2E tests for critical user flows

## 📝 Notes

- All implemented pages follow the same patterns:
  - Form validation before submission
  - Loading states during API calls
  - Error handling with user-friendly messages
  - Mock data fallback when API unavailable
  - Responsive design with mobile support
  - Theme-aware styling

- The codebase is ready for the remaining implementations as all infrastructure is in place.

## 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **Fixed import error in TransferPage.tsx**: Changed `mockBalances` to `mockCurrencyBalances` to match the actual export name from `/src/data/mockBalances.ts`
